**Singleton Pattern**

* Only one instance created
* Guarantees control of a resource
* Lazily Loaded
* Thread-safe Operation
* Examples : Runtime, Logger, Spring Beans, Graphic Managers

**Pitfalls**
* Often overused
* Difficult to unit test
* if not careful, not thread-safe

**Summary**
* Return same instance
* One constructor method - no args
* No Interface
